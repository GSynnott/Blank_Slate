She fires repeatedly, \n    flames leaping from the muzzle; the SOUND is an echoing roar \n    in these close quarters, but -\n    Clarice has come up on one knee, beside an armchair, and is \n    already firing back herself, two quick SHOTS, which send -\n    THE HOSTAGE\n    pitching over the bed, backwards, to shudder and lie still \n    in a haze of gunsmoke. Clarice rushes to her, clamping one \n    knee down on her gun hand, still keeping her covered in case \n    of movement.

    MIGUEL (V.O.)
Sometimes I think I'm cursed...
'cause of something that happened
before I was even born.

A story begins to play out on the papel picado.

    MIGUEL (V.O.)
See, a long time ago there was this
family.

The images on the papel picado come to life to illustrate a
father, a mother, and a little girl. The family is happy.

    MIGUEL (V.O.)
The pap�, he was a musician.

The pap� plays guitar while the mother dances with her
daughter.

     MIGUEL (V.O.)
He and his family would sing, and
dance, and count their blessings...
(beat)
But he also had a dream... to play
for the world.
(beat)
And one day he left with his
guitar... and never returned.

The man walks down a road, guitar slung on his back. In
another vignette his daughter stands in the doorway, watching
her pap� leave. Two feet step up next to her. It is her
mam�, hardened.

She shuts the door.                                           2.


     MIGUEL (V.O.)
And the mam�...? She didn't have
time to cry over that walkaway
musician!
(beat)
After banishing all music from her
life...

The woman gets rid of all of her husband's instruments and
records.

     MIGUEL (V.O.)
She found a way to provide for her
daughter...
(beat)
She rolled up her sleeves and she
learned to make shoes.
(beat)
She could have made candy!

Amongst the papel picado, a stick swings at a strung up
pi�ata which bursts with candy...

    MIGUEL (V.O.)
Or fireworks!

Fireworks go off in the background...

    MIGUEL (V.O.)
Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers!

Sparkly underwear and a luchador mask hang on a line amongst
other linens...

    MIGUEL (V.O.)
But no... she chose shoes...

On the papel picado, the little girl becomes a young woman.

    MIGUEL (V.O.)
Then she taught her daughter to
make shoes. And later, she taught
her son-in-law.

She introduces a suitor to the family business.

    MIGUEL (V.O.)
Then her grandkids got roped in.
As her family grew, so did the
business.

In the next vignette, a bunch of goofy grandchildren join in
the shoemaking. The shoe shop is full of family!","status": "published","assignedTo": null

    INT. GRUBBY HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

    A woman's face BACKS INTO SHOT, her head resting against 
    grimy wallpaper. She is tense, sweaty, wide-eyed with 
    concentration. This is CLARICE STARLING, mid-20's, trim, 
    very pretty. She wears Kevlar body armor over a navy 
    windbreaker, khaki pants. Her thick hair is piled under a 
    navy baseball cap. A revolver, clutched in her right hand, 
    hovers by her ear. She raises a speedloader, in her left 
    hand, locks it into her cylinder, twists and reloads.

    CLOSE ON

    A guest room door, with a small, wired pack attached to its 
    knob. Suddenly, wish a sharp CRACK!, the knob explodes, and 
    the door bursts open.

    WITH CLARICE - MOVING SHOT

    as she runs around a corner, through a cloud of smoke. She 
    shoulders aside the shattered door and rushes inside, gun at 
    the ready in both hands...

    INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

    CLARICE'S POV - MOVING - as she first sees, sitting on the 
    edge of a bed - a FEMALE HOSTAGE. Black, late 20's, gagged, 
    hands behind her back. Then, SWIVELLING... she sees a startled 
    MALE SUSPECT, white, mid-20's, standing by a window with a 
    rifle in his hands. He is turning towards her...

    Clarice drops into a combat crouch, gun extended, and shouts.

                          CLARICE
              Freeze! FBI!

    CLARICE'S POV - SLOW MOTION

    all natural SOUND suspended - as the Suspect faces her with 
    a strange, pleading expression. The rifle is rising in his 
    hands, but oddly enough, it is held across his chest, not 
    pointing. Then another puzzling detail registers...

    THE SUSPECT'S HANDS

    are taped to his gun, away from the trigger; he couldn't use 
    it even if he tried. Suddenly we hear a metallic CLICK, which 
    registers with unnatural amplification, as - Clarice reacts, 
    drops to the floor, rolling sideways, and -

    THE "HOSTAGE"

    pulls a revolver out from behind her back, still in SLOW 
    MOTION, raising it in her untied hands. She fires repeatedly, 
    flames leaping from the muzzle; the SOUND is an echoing roar 
    in these close quarters, but -

    Clarice has come up on one knee, beside an armchair, and is 
    already firing back herself, two quick SHOTS, which send -

    THE "HOSTAGE"

    pitching over the bed, backwards, to shudder and lie still 
    in a haze of gunsmoke. Clarice rushes to her, clamping one 
    knee down on her gun hand, still keeping her covered in case 
    of movement. HOLD for a few beats... then we hear the shrill 
    blast of a WHISTLE from somewhere, off screen, as normal 
    ACTION and SOUND are restored.","status": "draft","assignedTo": null

    It's gray. The platform is packed with business commuters:
    suits, overcoats. There is such a lack of color it almost
    seems as if it's a black and white shot, except one commuter
    holds a bright red heart-shaped box of candy under his arm.
    The platform across the tracks is empty. As an almost empty
    train pulls up to that platform, one of the suited men breaks
    out of the crowd, lurches up the stairs two at a time,
    hurries across the overpass and down the stairs to the other
    side, just at the empty train stops. The doors open and the

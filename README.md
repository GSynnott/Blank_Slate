Scritomatic is a web application that enables writers to create and manage their scripts, and agents to browse, purchase and own scripts posted on the platform. This platform provides a workspace for writers to create, edit and delete drafts and post their scripts on the market, where agents can browse and purchase scripts that interest them. Agents can message writers to ask questions before and after purchasing a script. The platform tracks the status of each script to ensure that only one agent owns a script. This platform also enables writers to view their posted scripts and their status, and agents to view their purchased scripts. The intent of this we application is to provide a streamlined platform that simplifies the process of connecting writers and agents, and facilitates the sale and ownership of scripts.

Our goal is to provide a useful platform for both writers and agents in the entertainment industry. This platform provides a centralized marketplace for writers to showcase their scripts and for agents to easily browse, purchase, and own high-quality scripts. This platform will help speed up the process in which scripts are moved to the next stage of development. Additionally, this platform will allow for direct messaging between writers and agents, ensuring that each script meets the unique needs and specifications of the agent. Overall, the team believes that the proposed web application has the potential to improve the movie production industry by providing a streamlined platform that allows writers to showcase their work and for agents to discover and purchase high-quality scripts that meet their needs.
